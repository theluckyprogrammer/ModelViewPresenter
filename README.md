# ModelViewPresenter
When last time I've been working on windows forms application I've came to conclusion that I should use some design pattern.
Meantime I took part in the job interviw, recruiter asked me to wrote simple application in whatever technology I'm familiar with. This was great opportunity to establish model view presenter solution.

Recruiter requirments were simple, I had to make customer registry with basic crud operations so I've made one view with two panels and 
context menu. 


**Second panel support crud operations, mouse right click to open context menu with operations.**

**More in wiki.**
